# Gridlock! - Ludum Dare 51

A game about balancing the electrical grid of a country.  
Can you satisfy the growing electricity demands without turning to astronomical prices?

My entry to the 51:th Ludum Dare game jam (theme: *Delay the inevitable*), following the compo rules (alone, from scratch, 48 hours).
